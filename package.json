  "description": "This project is built around the versatile and affordable Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The goal is to develop a hardware-software solution capable of reliably tracking swim laps in real-time. The Raspberry Pi 4 was chosen for its robust performance and connectivity featuresâ€”it offers ample GPIO pins for sensor integration, multiple USB ports for debugging and accessories, and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless syncing and remote control.",
